AudioXBlock
===========

This is a simple XBlock which will play audio files as an HTML5 audio
element. If unavailable, it will fall back to an embed element.

Add "audio" to the Advanced Module List array in Advanced Settings in Studio for each course this should be installed in.

Usage: 

    <audio src="http://server.tld/static/song.mp3" />
